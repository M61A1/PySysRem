This code is an algorithm to remove systematic effects in a large set of
light curves based on a paper by O. Tamuz, T. Mazeh and S. Zucker (2004)
titled "Correcting systematic effects in a large set of photometric light
curves".

Originally written for PTF data by a student of Nick Law, and
modified by Marcel Agueros
